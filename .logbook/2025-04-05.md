iterating back to the core [idea](./2025-04-04.md), it is to allow users to **save** and **manage bookmarks** using **natural language processing**. the app parses user input and extracts:

- link(s)
- title (optional)
- favicon
- tags
- notes
- collections or categories
- reminders / scheduling metadata

interface sketch in plain text:

- command input at the top, much like raycast
- below: list of bookmarks, sorted by most recent or filters

command input:

```txt
> save “https://stripe.com” under finance, payments. note: clean UI inspiration.
```

ergonomic keyboard-first UX (cmd+k to jump to input, arrows to navigate)

interactions:

- autocomplete/tag suggestions as you type
- press [Enter] to parses the sentence and give a “parsed summary” (title, tags, notes, ...)

bookmark list item UI

using base-ui primitives like Popover, Tooltip, Dialog, Preview Card, Menu for interactions:

- title
- URL (clickable)
- tags (with quick filter buttons)
- note (shown on hover or expanded view)
- on hover “…” menu for copy / edit / delete / move to / refetch

design ethos

- zero friction: saves should feel like talking to a helpful assistant
- fast: the benchmark to beat is pen & paper&mdash;any slower is a failure
- ergonomic. keyboard-first
- readable storage: everything could export to markdown, HTML, or plain text
- privacy-first: user data is private and portable
- responsive, performant, and expressive: focus on fluid animations, motion where appropriate
- simplicity, an elusive luxury in today's world

next step is to do some research & development, study some natural language interfaces and tools with similar interaction models
